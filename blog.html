      I had a bit of trouble with the formatting of the picture, but once I figured that out I didn't have any other problems with the assignment.
      I knew nothing about HTML before this assignment, so literally everything to do with HTML was new for me. I already had some experience with Github though,
      so I knew how to add, commit and push things already.
      I just used the internet if I had a question about something. I also referred back to the recorded lectures for information on the HTML involved in this assignment.

      I had some trouble with this assignment but I think it turned out decent overall. I struggled with the 'flex' aspect of getting everything in order, but other than
      than that everything was decently straightforward, everything just took a long time to get right. It was fun at times though when I had finally mastered how to do something,
      because then I wasn't stressed about actually learning the thing and I could just play around with it until I had it like I wanted. Overall though it was super informative for
      me as I had never worked with CSS before so I was learning a whole bunch of stuff.
