      I had a bit of trouble with the formatting of the picture, but once I figured that out I didn't have any other problems with the assignment.
      I knew nothing about HTML before this assignment, so literally everything to do with HTML was new for me. I already had some experience with Github though,
      so I knew how to add, commit and push things already.
      I just used the internet if I had a question about something. I also referred back to the recorded lectures for information on the HTML involved in this assignment.
